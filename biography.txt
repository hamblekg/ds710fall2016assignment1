1. What is your name?
My name is Kyle Hamble

2. Why are you interested in Data Science?
I've always been interested in working with statistics and I enjoy coding.

3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?
I have quite a bit of programming experience. Initially, I started working with programming while in the Marine Corps as a calibration technician.
After I got out, I went to college at UW-Eau Claire for Information Systems focusing on systems development. I have taken courses that focused on
SQL, Visual Basic, HTML, and Java. Currently I am a software developer at Schreiber Foods and use SQL, Visual Basic, JavaScript and some C.

4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?
I used statistics heavily in the Marine Corps when testing tolerances for electronic gear. I took a basic statistics course in college because
my major didn't require us to even take a statistics course, but I was interested in taking it. I enjoyed it though. I don't use much statistics on the job at Schreiber, 
but they are going to allow me to see how our business intelligence unit works with forecasting and how it's coded.

5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?
I do not have any experience in R or Python programming.

6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?
I hope to gain a better understanding of each of these coding languages and how they can be applied to a business situation.

7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
I look forward to meeting everyone and learning from everyone as well. Also, go Packers!
